## What did I learn in this chapter?

    - React element
    - JSX
    - Always use camelCase while giving attribute to JSX
    - React component
    - React Functional component
    - Component composition (Injecting one component into another)
    - Injecting javascript code inside a react component using {}
    - babel (transpilled the jsx code into js code)
